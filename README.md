# Javascript Quiz <h1>

This application was created for the purpose of testing Javascript knowledge and keeping track of progress via highscores. 

Upon opening the page the user will be given brief instruction and a button to start the quiz.

The quiz gives each user 75 seconds to answer five questions testing their knowledge of Javascript. 

When the user clicks "start quiz" the timer starts counting down. When the user selects an answer, it will say "correct" or "incorrect" underneath the answers and automatically move on to the next question. 

This is a work in progress and does not have complete functionality yet. 

Updated 1/6: This page now has a link to highscore page and stores the user's score in local storage. It also displays the user's intials and score when clicking save. However this is still a work in progress as I was not able to get the scores to persist.
